	<h2>you will miss him......</h2>
	<img src="images/oo.jpg" class="photo" height="800" width="600">


	<p>One thing i can promise you, you will look for him in the people you love. One day he will be the one, not answering your calls and messages, one day he'll just scroll down your post and status because they'll not bother him anymore. You will search for his hand whenever you feel lost. You will miss his voice whenever you feel alone and you will miss his presence when you badly want someone to listen you.<br><br>
One day you'll miss him, his texts, his attention, his efforts, his care , his craziness, his madness, his love and the way he apologized after every fight even if it was not his mistake because for him there was no point in winning an argument over you, you will miss him when you realise, he can't be compared to anyone.<br><br>
one day you will find your another half and you will want him the same way he wanted you. You will miss his sacrifices whenever you had to sacrifice your something to get your half. You will miss him badly whenever your half treat you the same way you treated him. You will know the value of his tears whenever your half uses the same words to scold you as you used to use them for him. You will miss him when nobody understands your pain.<br><br>
One day you will hear songs that will make you miss him and you will change it as fast as you can. You will miss him whenever you go to those places where you had shared some memory with him. You will regret everything and you'd wish you could apologize . And he will not be there looking at his phone screen hours and hours waiting for your one text to fix everything. You will miss him so badly that you will want to hug him so tight and will not want to let him go again but trust me it will be late, he will be gone, he will not come back in your life again. He will not bother you from his madness anymore, he will not make you laugh from his lame jokes anymore. one day you will miss him and you will regret that he left silently and he will not be there for you anymore.....</p>
