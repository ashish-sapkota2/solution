<p>After I had break up I encountered many questions from my friends and even from my relatives like: why you ended like this?, You guys used to look cool together, is there any chances left that you two might come back again??, how can you be so chill when someone you love left you?, how can you give up on your dream of having her?, i don't think you are affected by her absence in your life, are you?,, and many more.... <br><br>
Talking about why it don't affect me, I consider my life as a book and every events or incidents that occurs as a chapters which are written by pen not a pencil so you cannot erase the events/chapters that had already occured in your life/book, and myself as the writer of my book. I create the character in each chapter of my book, I allow them to be on my book/life. so i am allowed to make changes on my book not the characters. when one chapter ends it shouldnot affect the next chapter of book. And even the previous chapter´s character should not affect your next chapter´s story likewise why you need to be worried when someone left you?? Ok, it may affect you greatly, you are even allowed to cry whole night but for sometime or some days only coz when you close the chapter it should not affect your next chapter likewise i too closed my chapter of love and i already started my new chapter so there is not point of going back to the previous chapter and modifying it coz it already ended and the modification cannot be made because it is the life where there is no vaccant space after the ending of chapter. So going back is worthless.<br><br>

Talking about dreams. Its like falling in love with the character of your story and imagining the things that will never happen. Dreams are called dreams because they are rarely fullfilled. I don't give up on my dreams, i just end the previous dream with previous character and start dreaming with new character of new chapter.<br><br>

Talking about endings, breaking up with her was also one of the chapter of my book where i got to know about love, care, attention, fights, sentiments, emotions, attachement, heart breaks, jealousy and many more which ended up unconditionally. I had never expected that i will end the chapter in this way. I always wanted to write this chapter so long that i never wanted to end it but if it ended then it is ok you should not stuck in that chapter you should move on and write another chapter coz if you stuck in one chapter then you can never complete you book and success will not be your cup of tea. we all know one chapter is not enough for the book except a romantic novel, so you should keep on writing chapters. Every chapter may not have perfect ending but it allows you to write new chapter with great new story. You are the writer but how you write each chapter of your book is important. You need to be a great writer to make your book/life successful. And one bad chapter cannot make you a bad writer so let the bad chapter be in its place and come with next great chapter.
